# Quiet-Darius
When all your pilots are max level, there's not really much point to being told about their growing pools of XP.

Overrides `ShowMechWarriorTrainingNotif` with modified version that makes sure it's not counting a pilot's maxed out skills for the notification.

# Installation Instructions

1. Install the Battletech Mod Loader if you don't have it yet. Can be found here: https://github.com/Mpstark/BattleTechModLoader/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha

2. Download latest release.

3. Put .dll in `BATTLETECH\Mods`. Make the `Mods` folder if it doesn't exist yet.

4. Darius should now only bug you when it's applicable.
